I definitely want:

Walking/Running/Jumping/Double Jumping. Backflips would be good spice

Major goal points to collect. AKA our ship pieces, for now.

Fluff to collect, like coconuts, along with something to interact with, like boxes to smash to collect said coconuts.
You mentioned hanging.

Climbing-related animations would add a lot of verticality to the game, but I think we should only consider this if everything else is going really smoothly
